It was a pretty seismic Sunday in Week 11.

The Chiefs and Ravens both lost. The 49ers fell again in dramatic fashion. The Packers and Chargers stood tall late, but it took some serious sweat to see those victories through. The Bears' and Bengals' playoff hopes are now on fumes.

Josh Allen's memorable touchdown run on fourth-and-2 not only swung some MVP momentum his way after the Steelers kept Lamar Jackson under wraps, but it also kept the Bills in position to potentially swipe the AFC's top seed. Meanwhile, Bo Nix seems to be stealing some of Jayden Daniels ' Offensive Rookie of the Year thunder, with each of their teams currently holding the last wild-card bid in their respective conferences.

There was some natural order, with last week's No. 1 team (Detroit) demolishing last week's No. 32 team (Jacksonville). Nothing changes there.

But big picture, how much really changed? The playoff races appear to be more about seeding right now. Teams like the Colts, Buccaneers, Seahawks and Niners have their work cut out for them to get seats at the table.

There's still plenty of entropy, but it's a very tightly packed group of true contenders right now. We're just reshuffling the deck chairs a bit this week.

Detroit Lions
Detroit Lions
9-1
Beating the Jaguars by 46 at home boosted the Lions' point differential through 10 games this season to plus-159, which is currently their best mark as a franchise since 1934, the team's first year in Detroit. They're also plus-99 in five home games, one of which was a loss. That's decent. There's not a whole lot to dissect from this game in particular -- outside of the broken forearm that sent linebacker Alex Anzalone to injured reserve. I will not entertain any rabble-rousers complaining that the team should have rested its starters, because the Lions don't operate that way -- they don't play to not get hurt. Also, Anzalone's injury came in the second quarter, which began with Detroit holding a 7-3 advantage. The Lions remain the leaders for the NFC's No. 1 seed (although the Eagles are within striking distance), and Anzalone could be back for the playoffs. Look at how they've responded to the loss of Aidan Hutchinson , holding opponents to 17.2 points per game (fourth-least in the NFL) in five games played without Hutchinson. Four of Detroit's final seven games are at home, and there is exactly one more trip outside of the Midwest remaining: for a Week 17 contest in San Francisco. The Lions are on a quest, and I tend to doubt they'll be denied.

Buffalo Bills

Josh Allen 's fourth-and-2 TD rumble will be talked about for some time. Was it his "MVP moment"? Perhaps. Did it start the boulder rolling toward the Bills taking the AFC crown? We'll see. Buffalo has six games remaining, while Kansas City has seven, and the Bills are still a game back in the loss column. But even with their run game stalling at times, they made a statement by dropping 30 points on a Chiefs defense that hadn't allowed an opponent to score that many in a regular-season game in more than two years. That they did it without Dalton Kincaid or Keon Coleman is a testament to Allen and his ability to lift everyone around him. Buffalo's defense certainly did its job, forcing interceptions on K.C.'s first and last possessions and inducing three-and-outs on three separate occasions in between. Not to mention, the unit could get Matt Milano back for the home stretch. The Bills are by no means perfect, but they can go toe to toe with just about any team right now.

If the Chiefs had won Sunday, they might have all but wrapped up the AFC's No. 1 seed. Now that race is in doubt, with the Bills on their tails and the Steelers a few lengths back (a Week 17 meeting in Pittsburgh looms). So we've gone from talking about an unbeaten season to suddenly wondering if Kansas City will end up with a first-round bye in the playoffs. We know from history that only matters so much; for two of their three Super Bowl wins during the Andy Reid era, the Chiefs were not the conference's top seed. Taking the long, hard road to a third straight Super Bowl title is still a big, big ask, even for this legendary dynasty. The most difficult part about Sunday's defeat to Buffalo is that some of the big dogs came up short. Patrick Mahomes threw two tough picks, Travis Kelce was held in check, DeAndre Hopkins was quiet and the vaunted defense did not perform up to its typical standard.

Philadelphia Eagles

It's time to start thinking of the Eagles as championship contenders again. Thursday's 26-18 win over the Commanders felt more resounding than the score indicated, with some kicking issues on Philadelphia's end keeping Washington in the game. Most importantly, the win staked the Eagles to a bigger lead in the NFC East and kept them one game behind the Lions in the race for the NFC's top seed. We've learned to accept their slow offensive starts; in nearly every game since the Week 5 bye, they've slow-cooked their way to a roiling boil by the final whistle. Defensively, they're also vastly improved. The Eagles mauled the Commanders on both lines of scrimmage. That's a sign of a playoff-ready squad. Philly looks like a different -- and far more dangerous -- team than last year's Eagles, whose 10-1 start was revealed to be fool's gold.

Minnesota Vikings
Minnesota Vikings

Sam Darnold was charged with a fumble after his errant pitch on the Vikings' third play from scrimmage, and there was a sense of here we go again. But the win over the Titans ended up being a big bounceback game for the QB, who played pretty darned well for three quarters, until the offense went into a bit of a shell late. Darnold also took a costly fourth-quarter sack that might have been more impactful against a better opponent. Still, the early fumble was his only turnover of the game. The Vikings' defense did its job by sacking Will Levis five times and limiting the Titans' scoring chances, even with a few coverage busts. Tennessee ran 55 offensive plays; four of them accounted for 182 yards, and the remaining 51 plays netted just 112 yards. It wasn't artwork, but the Vikings won by double digits on the road. Now the meat of their schedule lies ahead. The playoffs are well within reach, but they'll be tested down the stretch.

Pittsburgh Steelers
Pittsburgh Steelers
8-2
Nick Herbig really set the tone for the Steelers' win over the Ravens on the second play from scrimmage, when he made a terrific strip of Derrick Henry , who coughed up his first lost fumble in nearly two years. Patrick Queen 's strip right before halftime was similarly momentous. Each takeaway only led to a field goal, however, and the Ravens had to miss two kicks in order for Pittsburgh to be up at halftime by two points. I'm in no way downplaying the defensive job the Steelers did on Lamar Jackson , which was a four-quarter assault. That unit became the story of the day in a cage-match battle for AFC North supremacy. But Russell Wilson really struggled against pressure and in the red zone. While George Pickens and Najee Harris made some plays, Chris Boswell truly saved the offense's bacon with his six field goals, three of them from 50-plus yards. If there's a worry about this streaking Steelers team right now, it's probably related to its offensive consistency, or lack thereof. That said, the AFC's top seed remains in reach.

Baltimore Ravens

Sunday's loss to Pittsburgh is going to leave a mark. If the Ravens cannot win the AFC North, we might look back at this game as the turning point in that race. They're only a game and a half back of the Steelers but two games back in the loss column, and Baltimore has one fewer game left than Pittsburgh, which means one less chance to make up that gap. Now the rematch in Baltimore is virtually a must-win affair for the Ravens. Even though the Steelers' defense dominated in this one, Baltimore had ample opportunities to win prior to the missed two-point attempt that would have tied it late. Turnovers were a problem, but it really came down to field goals, with Pittsburgh's Chris Boswell making all six of his tries and usual Steelers killer Justin Tucker missing two first-quarter kicks. That's now six misses on the season for Tucker , one shy of his career high. Baltimore's D stepped up Sunday, but the team has to wonder whether it can count on Tucker from distance in clutch situations now. While the Ravens are by no means in trouble, there are some concerns when the offense is not cooking.

The Packers came up with enough big plays in key moments to pull out another thrilling win in Chicago. They were also, frankly, pretty fortunate. And not just because the Bears perhaps made things easier on them by not trying to get closer before their blocked field-goal try . Green Bay left the game with some questions defensively after allowing a wayward offense to find its rhythm and move the ball consistently for much of the afternoon. How did the Packers look so good on the opening drive, then fall into a funk for the next two quarters -- coming off a bye, against their biggest rivals? Thankfully, Jordan Love regained his form late, and Christian Watson came up with some hero catches after halftime. It wasn't pretty at all, but it was very helpful for Green Bay's playoff profile.

The Chargers made as wide a swing as was imaginable on Sunday night, looking like a dark-horse Super Bowl team in the first half, then nearly coughing up what would have been an inexcusable loss -- one that would have also significantly damaged their playoff hopes. After opening the game scorching hot, Justin Herbert froze over pretty fast, going 5-for-18 passing at one point in the second half and missing two big throws to Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey . The QB's early fourth-quarter fumble ( Herbert 's first turnover since Week 2) led to the Bengals tying things up, and it looked like Cincinnati was going to walk out of there with a win. But Herbert hit McConkey for 28 and 27 yards in the final minute, and the Chargers escaped a game that had a playoff-like atmosphere. The competition only gets tougher from here on out, too, so they'd better be prepared for more of these types of battles.

It's hard not to notice the downward trend the Commanders' attack has been on since Jayden Daniels suffered a rib injury in Week 7. The problem is, they need their offense to carry them past their defensive issues. A step up in competition might be a factor; either way, for the first time since September, we're starting to see some cracks in their armor. They're a miraculous Hail Mary away from having three losses in their past four games, with two narrow wins over teams with losing records keeping them afloat in that span. Washington continues to have an 81 percent chance of making the postseason, per Next Gen Stats, but a lack of consistent playmakers and an inability to finish off games is a bit concerning. Facing the Cowboys and Titans at home gives the Commanders a chance to rebound. If they continue to struggle to move the ball or put points on the board, then it might be time to worry.

Nico Collins' opening-play touchdown was called back, and it was emblematic of the Texans' offensive night: plenty of encouraging signs, mixed with bouts of frustration and inefficiency. That said, Joe Mixon still paid off that opening drive with a 45-yard touchdown run, providing an important early statement in the wake of back-to-back losses for Houston. The first-year Texan fueled the offense with 153 scrimmage yards and three scores, while C.J. Stroud settled down after a bad early pick and Collins made an impact in his return from injury. But the offense only crossed midfield once from the 9:00 mark of the second quarter until Dallas turned it over on downs on its own 35-yard line with six minutes left in the fourth. Thankfully, the Texans' defense was smothering, led by Danielle Hunter 's two sacks, Derek Barnett's strip-and-score and Derek Stingley Jr.'s excellent coverage on CeeDee Lamb . This was a sigh-of-relief game for Houston, although it had a few testy moments between both teams. Rarely easy for the Texans this year.

Don't sweat the one-spot drop here. Even on their Week 11 bye, the Cardinals actually made gains in postseason positioning, sliding from the fourth seed in the NFC playoff field to the third spot, courtesy of the Falcons' loss at Denver. Arizona also received a bump in the divisional standings, thanks to the Seahawks' win over the 49ers. Now all three NFC West teams below them sit at 5-5, giving the Cardinals a full-game lead over the field. Arizona also hopes to get first-round pick Darius Robinson -- who has taken a long road to recovery from an August calf injury -- back in the mix. If there's a quiet story to keep an eye on, it's at kicker. Jonathan Gannon will have to weigh what to do if Matt Prater can return from injured reserve, something Gannon has said he expects. In Prater's place, Chad Ryland has converted every extra-point try while missing just one of 12 field-goal attempts; he also booted winning kicks against the 49ers, Chargers and Dolphins. With the stakes rising, will the Cardinals stick with Ryland , go back to Prater or make it a competition? Half of Arizona's games have been one-score affairs, so this looming call is significant.

There was no better way to rebound from tough losses to the Ravens and Chiefs than with a thorough demolition of the Falcons at home. These Broncos can play. I knew the defense was legitimate going into Sunday, and that observation was only further hardened. Seeing Bo Nix dissect Atlanta's zone defenses all game was highly encouraging. Sean Payton remains the genius of the operation, as there appeared to be some guardrails and predetermined reads throughout the game script, but the rookie quarterback executed them to perfection. And when Nix had a few chances to create, he fared well. The schedule lines up pretty nicely over the next few games, even with the tough home stretch. If the Broncos can hold firm, there's a playoff spot with their name on it.

After limping into their Week 11 bye with four straight excruciating losses, the Buccaneers have to feel like they've been given a reprieve, thanks to the way the Falcons are playing. Atlanta was once assumed by many to be the big NFC South favorite after sweeping Tampa Bay and starting out 4-0 in the division, but everything has shifted over the past few weeks. The Bucs' next three games are against teams with a combined 7-23 record; all three opponents (the Giants in Week 12, Panthers in Week 13 and Raiders in Week 14) have made quarterback changes this season. Shortly after that, they head to Dallas (another team using its backup QB), then face Carolina for a second time. Tampa still must win most of its games down the stretch while hoping the Falcons keep floundering and the Saints do not suddenly get hot, but the Bucs have life again. They were in a similar spot last year before cranking up the afterburners and winning a playoff game. I'm not ruling out something similar happening again.

Who knows if the Seahawks can somehow find a way into the postseason dance? Right now, they're a real long shot and still need a lot to happen down the stretch (which, for them, features a tough slate of opponents) to get there. Still, Sunday's win at San Francisco was a true statement of mental and physical toughness -- and it dealt a huge blow to the rival 49ers' chances. Seattle slumped into its Week 10 bye with five losses in six tries, sinking below .500 after a 3-0 start. The team waived leading tackler Tyrel Dodson last week, then Connor Williams shockingly retired prior to Sunday's game. It seemed as if the 'Hawks were heading to Levi's Stadium followed by a dark cloud. But the skies finally cleared as Geno Smith galloped to his dramatic TD run with 12 seconds left, stunning the Niners, and suddenly everything was right again, even if just for a moment. Hope is not yet lost.

There's no other way to say it: Sunday's loss to the Seahawks was crushing. Blowing leads against NFC West opponents has become a chronic issue. Sure, the Niners were playing without George Kittle (and, for most of the second half, Nick Bosa), and a few bad breaks went against them. Those mitigating factors don't make the outcome count less when it comes to the playoff picture. If San Francisco misses the postseason -- and, as of Monday night, the team had just a 29 percent chance of making it, per Next Gen Stats -- we'll look back on this one as one of the bigger reasons why, along with earlier losses to the Rams and Cardinals. The 49ers were more in control of those games. Even so, on Sunday, they did have the ball at the Seattle 46-yard line, protecting a 17-13 lead with three minutes left. That's usually when Kyle Shanahan teams (especially at this time of year) bleed out the clock or score to put the game away. Instead, the Niners had to punt and then watch their defense allow Geno Smith and Co. to drive 80 yards in two-plus minutes for the game-winning touchdown. After all the 49ers have been through, the playoffs just might not be in the cards this season.

It's hard to understate how brutal this loss in Denver was. The offense fell flat after two penalties killed the opening drive. The defense allowed Bo Nix to carve Atlanta up all day. There were rough injuries at positions where the Falcons were already thin, such as wide receiver and in the secondary. Even a few calls seemed to go against them. The Week 12 bye might be a soul-searching operation, as it's becoming clear that the NFC South can slip away from them. Atlanta's 6-3 start and 4-0 mark in the division have fizzled, and the four-win Bucs and Saints are just playing better ball. This will be Raheem Morris' biggest test in Year 1 as Atlanta's coach, with the Falcons' playoff lives hanging in the balance and only six games left to prove they are worthy.

The Dolphins didn't expand their lead over the Raiders beyond one possession until there was less than five minutes left in the third quarter, so let's not get too excited. Still, finishing with a season-high 34 points -- thanks to touchdowns scored on three straight second-half possessions, plus a late field goal -- was a positive development. Miami has taken too long to get the offense cranked up in the four games since Tua Tagovailoa returned to the lineup, with four TDs and five field goals before halftime in that span and eight TDs and four field goals after. The playoffs remain a stretch, and the Bills have all but clinched the AFC East race, but Miami can still mount a run, with two games left against the Jets, plus contests with the Patriots and Browns. If the Fins can keep getting the ball in the hands of their playmakers, with increased roles for Tyreek Hill and De'Von Achane , they can make things interesting.

(We’ll overlook yet another slow start for just a minute.) Puka Nacua ’s diving TD was terrific. Stafford’s throw to Colby Parkinson was just dirty. Granted, the Patriots defense has been more bad than good this season, and the Rams had some shaky moments of their own on defense and special teams. But they’ll take a zero-turnover, four-TD performance most weeks. The Dolphins loss still stings, but it was important to win this one to give them a chance at the postseason.

By no means was Richardson close to perfect in the game, fumbling twice and losing one of them, but it was a strong step in the right direction after his benching. Shane Steichen also seemed to guide Richardson well with a game plan that suited his skills, allowing the Colts to remain squarely in the playoff hunt, so it was a productive day all around. They’re on the outside looking in, and no Colts fans will view narrowly missing the playoffs again as a successful development, but they have a chance to rewrite the ending with at least four more winnable games on the schedule.

Early in Sunday night’s thriller, everything was going the Chargers’ way, and anyone watching could see how disgusted Joe Burrow and the gang looked as the Bengals fell into a 27-6 hole. Incredibly, they not only pulled out of that, tying the game at 27-all, but the Bengals absolutely looked like the better team at that point, almost destined to pull off an all-time comeback. Instead, they took what was most likely another step toward missing the postseason, and it happened in the stadium where their Super Bowl hopes were crushed a few years ago. At their best, the Bengals can hang with virtually anyone in the NFL. At their worst, they’re just as capable of giving games away. Sadly, that has become the theme for the season: close, painful losses caused by self-inflicted wounds.

But it was also a window to the future, one where Williams can be a very good QB. And a serious shoutout to Brown , who leaned on the run (a 50-50 mix), got the ball out of Williams’ hands quickly, gave the QB opportunities to scramble and also got all of Chicago’s playmakers the ball. Those were things Shane Waldron was not doing before he was replaced.

New Orleans might need a tall ladder and a long arm to get there, of course. This might be one of those cases where the bye week works against a team like the Saints. They've gotten their mojo working the past two games to rebound from their seven-game losing streak; stalling that momentum with a Week 12 bye could be a detriment. Then again, they might also have a few starters coming back from injury, so perhaps it works out fine. In Sunday's win over the Browns, Taysom Hill rushed for a career-high 138 yards -- more than his season total coming in -- on just seven carries. He also set new career highs in receptions (eight) and targets (10) and tied his career high with three rushing TDs. We'll forget Hill's INT and fumble for now, but the Saints will need to be tighter with the ball when they return to action in Week 13 with a big one against the Rams.

There’s a certain irony to the Jets scoring a season-high 27 points and still losing, with their once-respected defense crumbling down the stretch. What happened to this group? After a solid run of games on that side of the ball early in the season, it has almost completely fallen apart outside of a good showing at home against the Texans in a short-week game. But even after the Jets allowed Anthony Richardson to carve them up for the go-ahead score, they had one last shot to pull one out. In a lost season, it would have given the down-bad fans something to cheer about. Instead, Aaron Rodgers was sacked twice in the final three plays of the game, and a miserable year turned even more bitter. The Jets are 3-8 and might only be favored in one remaining game, against the Jags. Imagine thinking this year’s club could be even less competitive than the Zach Wilson -led 2023 group. Well, we’re here. And if you're wondering how the Jets moved up, it's because they were the least bad of all the teams below them on this list in Week 11 (and before).

Dallas' fifth straight loss was a slow, painful bleed. It was not Brandon Aubrey 's night, and on those rare occasions, it's usually also not the Cowboys' night. First, the kicker shanked his 40-yard try near the end of the first half, which was shocking for him. Then he made a 64-yarder, no biggie. But down 20-10, Dallas took the points off the board after Houston was hit with a personal foul on the play, with the Cowboys opting to try for a touchdown instead. You know how that worked out: They ultimately turned it over on downs, getting zero points on the drive. Cooper Rush finished with only one pick, but the Texans dropped multiple other potential interceptions, and the Cowboys quarterback lost a fumble early in the fourth quarter that ended up a Texans defensive touchdown ( via Tyler Guyton 's fumble of Rush's fumble ). Then a penalty wiped out a miracle fourth-down conversion, and that was that. Rush battled, but Zack Martin got hurt late, the blocking crumbled more, and there's just no point putting a bow on this one. KaVontae Turpin's touchdown was amazing, and then the Cowboys never gave it to him again on offense before the final drive of the game, down 34-10. Also amazing.

Cleveland had 443 yards of offense and zero turnovers against New Orleans ... but totaled just 14 points.

The Browns allowed 473 yards and 35 points to the Saints and also had a bad all-around game on special teams, too. If there was a bright spot with an eye on the future, it was that some of the playmakers stepped up with big outings. Jerry Jeudy had his best game as a Brown, with 142 receiving yards, including an 89-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. David Njoku , Elijah Moore and Cedric Tillman also pitched in with good moments. All of them have shown signs of life since Cleveland traded away Amari Cooper , and the move to QB Jameis Winston hasn’t hurt, either. There aren’t many silver linings in three-TD losses, but the receivers were definitely one positive.

There are still rookie mistakes on the tape (e.g., the game-ending INT), but he moves his feet really well and has excellent feel and touch, especially when he’s extending plays and coloring a little outside the lines. There’s also just a veteran’s cool to his game. He’s not nearly the project I thought he’d be. But the Patriots too often have let him down, and Sunday was a prime example of that. Dropped passes, offensive line errors and penalties, and passive play-calling have hurt the QB's chances.

(Uh-oh.) Dave Canales appears to be continuing his stall tactics in terms of backing a starting quarterback, but it would stand to reason that Bryce Young will continue to get shots to impress. Even if he’s been better since regaining his starting job, there’s still vast room for improvement the Panthers want to see.

Well, it wasn’t a surprise that Daniel Jones lost his starting job after the Munich meltdown. But it is interesting that Tommy DeVito -- and not Drew Lock , the Giants' well-paid backup QB -- will be replacing Jones . Brian Daboll clearly believes DeVito can steal a game or two down the stretch better than Lock could. The Giants referred to the Jones benching as a “football decision,” even if there are financial ramifications involved, with Jones ’ injury guarantee for next year being quite sizable. But I also think it applies to DeVito over Lock . DeVito had his moment(s) last season, briefly rallying the Giants and earning folk-hero status before a wave of sacks sent him back to the bench. What’ll happen this time? Who knows, but the Giants have to win more games than they lose just to match last season’s six victories. It doesn’t feel all that likely from this vantage point.

Will Levis ’ bomb to Nick Westbrook-Ikhine that went for a 98-yard score gave the Titans life, and the offense put a few plays together in the second half. But in the fourth quarter Sunday , they settled for a field goal and turned it over twice on downs before Levis’ game-sealing pick . The Titans were also doomed by their earlier mistakes, including several drive-extending penalties that helped the Vikings offense significantly. This game came down to execution, and Minnesota was clearly superior in that department. One of the biggest differences between Brian Callahan’s Titans and the Bengals team he came from: Cincinnati has been one of the more disciplined clubs, flags-wise, since Zac Taylor became the head coach. But Tennessee now has 82 accepted penalties through 10 games under Callahan, with 67 of those setbacks coming in the past seven games. The Titans are also minus-11 in turnover differential, the second-worst mark in the league, so it’s no shock they’ve only won once since September.

The Raiders have lost six straight, with their next four games coming against teams still very much in the playoff race. Although they kept close with Miami well into the second half, the Raiders' defense imploded in the final 20-plus minutes, and the offense couldn’t keep pace. This was the first game with Scott Turner running the offense, and the results were not that bad. Brock Bowers was fed properly, totaling career highs in catches (13) and yards (126) and catching his third TD of the season. That and some more creative play-calling made the game interesting for a bit, at least by Raiders' standards this season. But there’s really only so much to be encouraged about in the big picture, with a slew of tough opponents left, until they can show they’re capable of an upset like the one they pulled at Arrowhead Stadium last year on Christmas Day.

Given NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport’s reporting about Doug Pederson’s status prior to the Jags’ 52-6 loss, it’s hard to envision a scenario where this coaching staff makes it through the end of the season. The entire operation, from soup to nuts, looks like a mess. Trevor Lawrence is hurt and hadn’t been playing great prior to the injury. The defense, which at least showed signs of life against the Eagles and Vikings, was blowtorched into submission Sunday. The Lions pulled Jared Goff and many starters early in the fourth quarter after they’d scored seven touchdowns in seven drives. All told, Detroit rang up 645 yards of offense against the Jags. This franchise has had some low low points, but it’s hard to remember many worse than now. The 1-15 season in 2020 was awful, but Jacksonville had gone 11-21 in the two seasons prior. This Jaguars franchise was in roughly the same spot as the Lions two years ago, as an up-and-coming team to watch. Now Jacksonville feels back at the bottom and in need of a hard refresh.
